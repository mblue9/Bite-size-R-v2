# Data manipulation with dplyr

**dplyr** is one of the packages that gets loaded as part of the tidyverse.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

dplyr is the Swiss army knife in the tidyverse, providing many useful functions
for manipulating tabular data in data frames or tibbles. We're going to look at
the key functions for filtering our data, modifying the contents and computing
summary statistics.

We'll also use the pipe operator, **`%>%`**, for chaining operations
together into mini workflows in a way that makes for more readable and
maintainable code.

Finally, we'll return to plotting and look at the powerful feature of ggplot2,
**faceting**, that allows you to divide your plots into subplots by splitting
the observations based on one or more categorical variables.

We'll again use the METABRIC data set to illustrate how these operations work.

```{r message = FALSE}
metabric <- read_csv("https://zenodo.org/record/6450144/files/metabric_clinical_and_expression_data.csv")
metabric
```

# dplyr verbs

We will be looking at the 5 key dplyr functions this session:

* **`filter()`** for filtering rows
* **`select()`** for selecting columns
* **`arrange()`** for sorting rows
* **`mutate()`** for modifying columns or creating new ones
* **`summarise()`** for computing summary values

In looking at each of these in turn, we'll be applying these to the entire data
set. It is possible to combine these with the `group_by()` function to instead
operate on separate groups within our data set but this is something we'll cover
in detail next session.

The dplyr operations are commonly referred to as "verbs" in a data manipulation
grammar. These verbs have a common syntax and work together in a consistent and
uniform manner. They all have the following shared behaviours:

* The first argument in each function is a data frame (or tibble)

* Any additional arguments describe what operation to perform on the data frame

* Variable names, i.e. column names, are referred to without using quotes

* The result of an operation is a new data frame

---

# Filtering rows with `filter()`

The **`filter`** verb allows you to choose rows from a data frame that match
some specified criteria. The criteria are based on values of variables and can
make use of comparison operators such as `==`, `>`, `<` and `!=`.

For example, to filter the METABRIC data set so that it only contains
observations for those patients who died of breast cancer we can use `filter()`
as follows.

```{r}
deceased <- filter(metabric, Vital_status == "Died of Disease")
deceased
```

Remember that the **`==`** operator tests for equality, i.e. is the value for
`Vital_status` for each patient (observation) equal to "Died of Disease".

Let's have a look at the various categories in the `Vital_status` variable.

```{r}
table(metabric$Vital_status)
```

We could use the `!=` comparison operator to select all deceased patients
regardless of whether they died of the disease or other causes, by filtering for
those that don't have the value "Living".

```{r}
deceased <- filter(metabric, Vital_status != "Living")
nrow(deceased)
```

Another way of doing this is to specify which classes we are interested in and
use the **`%in%`** operator to test which observations (rows) contain those
values.

```{r}
deceased <- filter(metabric, Vital_status %in% c("Died of Disease", "Died of Other Causes"))
nrow(deceased)
```

Another of the tidyverse packages, **`stringr`**, contains a set of very useful
functions for operating on text or character strings. One such function,
**`str_starts()`** could be used to find all `Vital_status` values that start
with "Died".

```{r}
deceased <- filter(metabric, str_starts(Vital_status, "Died"))
nrow(deceased)
```

Unsurprisingly there is an equivalent function, `str_ends()`, for matching the
end of text (character) values and `str_detect()` is another useful function
that determines whether values match a regular expression. Regular expressions
are a language for search patterns used frequently in computer programming and
really worth getting to grips with but sadly these are beyond the scope of this
course.

Filtering based on a logical variable is the most simple type of filtering of
all. We don't have any logical variables in our METABRIC data set so we'll
create one from the binary `Survival_status` variable to use as an example.

```{r}
# create a new logical variable called 'Deceased'
metabric$Deceased <- metabric$Survival_status == "DECEASED"
#
# filtering based on a logical variable - only selects TRUE values
deceased <- filter(metabric, Deceased)
#
# only display those columns we're interested in
select(deceased, Patient_ID, Survival_status, Vital_status, Deceased)
```

We can use the **`!`** operator to filter those patients who are not
deceased.

```{r eval = FALSE}
filter(metabric, !Deceased)
```

The eagle-eyed will have spotted that filtering on our newly created Deceased
logical variable gave a slightly different number of observations (patients) who
are considered to be deceased, compared with the filtering operations shown
above based on the `Vital_status` variable. We get one extra row. This is
because we have a missing value for the vital status of one of the patients. We
can filter for this using the **`is.na()`** function.

```{r}
missing_vital_status <- filter(metabric, is.na(Vital_status))

select(missing_vital_status, Patient_ID, Survival_status, Vital_status, Deceased)
```

`filter()` only retains rows where the condition if `TRUE`; both `FALSE` and
`NA` values are filtered out.

We can apply more than one condition in our filtering operation, for example
the patients who were still alive at the time of the METABRIC study and had
survived for more than 10 years (120 months).

```{r}
filter(metabric, Survival_status == "LIVING", Survival_time > 120)
```

We can add as many conditions as we like separating each with a comma. Adding conditions in this way is equivalent to combining the conditions using
the **`&`** (Boolean AND) operator.

```{r eval = FALSE}
filter(metabric, Survival_status == "LIVING", Survival_time > 120)
# is equivalent to
filter(metabric, Survival_status == "LIVING" & Survival_time > 120)
```

Naturally we can also check when either of two conditions holds true by using
the **`|`** (Boolean OR) operator. And we can build up more complicated
filtering operations using both `&` and `|`. For example, let's see which
patients have stage 3 or stage 4 tumours that are either estrogen receptor (ER)
positive or progesterone receptor (PR) positive.

```{r}
selected_patients <- filter(metabric, Tumour_stage >= 3, ER_status == "Positive" | PR_status == "Positive")
nrow(selected_patients)
```

In this case, if you used `&` in place of the comma you'd need to be careful
about the precedence of the `&` and `|` operators and use parentheses to make
clear what you intended.

```{r eval = FALSE}
filter(metabric, Tumour_stage >= 3 & (ER_status == "Positive" | PR_status == "Positive"))
```

---

# Selecting columns with `select()`

Another way of "slicing and dicing"" our tabular data set is to select just the
variables or columns we're interested in. This can be important particularly
when the data set contains a very large number of variables as is the case for
the METABRIC data. Notice how when we print the METABRIC data frame it is not
possible to display all the columns; we only get the first few and then a long
list of the additional ones that weren't displayed.

Using the `$` operator is quite convenient for selecting a single column and
extracting the values as a vector. However, for selecting multiple columns, the **`select()`** function from dplyr is simpler. We have already seen it a little when we used it above to view just a few columns in the dataset.

```{r}
select(metabric, Patient_ID, Survival_status, Vital_status, Deceased)
```

Notice the similarities with the `filter()` function. The first argument is the
data frame we are operating on and the arguments that follow on are specific to
the operation in question, in this case, the variables (columns) to select. Note
that the variables do not need to be put in quotes, and the returned value is
another data frame, even if only one column was selected.

We can alter the order of the variables (columns).

```{r}
select(metabric, Patient_ID, Vital_status, Survival_status, Deceased)
```

We can also select a range of columns using **`:`**, e.g. to select the patient
identifier and all the columns between `Tumour_size` and `Cancer_type` we could
run the following `select()` command.

```{r}
select(metabric, Patient_ID, Chemotherapy:Tumour_stage)
```

The help page for `select` points to some special functions that can be used
within `select()`. We can find all the columns, for example, that contain the
term "status" using `contains()`.

```{r}
select(metabric, contains("status"))
```

If we only wanted those ending with "status" we could use `ends_with()`
instead.

```{r}
select(metabric, ends_with("status"))
```

We can also select those columns we're not interested in and that shouldn't be
included by prefixing the columns with **`-`**.

```{r}
select(metabric, -Cohort)
```

You can use a combination of explicit naming, ranges, helper functions and
negation to select the columns of interest.

```{r}
selected_columns <- select(metabric, Patient_ID, starts_with("Tumour_"), `3-gene_classifier`:Integrative_cluster, -Cellularity)
selected_columns
```

You can also use `select()` to completely reorder the columns so they're in the
order of your choosing. The `everything()` helper function is useful in this
context, particularly if what you're really interested in is bringing one or
more columns to the left hand side and then including everything else
afterwards in whatever order they were already in.

```{r}
select(metabric, Patient_ID, Survival_status, Tumour_stage, everything())
```

Finally, columns can be renamed as part of the selection process.

```{r}
select(metabric, Patient_ID, Classification = `3-gene_classifier`, NPI = Nottingham_prognostic_index)
```

Note that dplyr provides the `rename()` function for when we only want to rename
a column and not select a subset of columns.

# Chaining operations using `%>%`

Let's consider again an earlier example in which we filtered the METABRIC data
set to retain just the patients who were still alive at the time of the study
and had survived for more than 10 years (120 months). We use `filter()` to
select the rows corresponding to the patients meeting these criteria and can
then use `select()` to only display the variables (columns) we're most
interested in.

```{r}
patients_of_interest <- filter(metabric, Survival_status == "LIVING", Survival_time > 120)
patient_details_of_interest <- select(patients_of_interest, Patient_ID, Survival_time, Tumour_stage, Nottingham_prognostic_index)
patient_details_of_interest
```

Here we've used an intermediate variable, `patients_of_interest`, which we only
needed in order to get to the final result. We could just have used the same
name to avoid cluttering our environment and overwritten the results from the
`filter()` operation with those of the `select()` operation.

```{r eval = FALSE}
patients_of_interest <- select(patients_of_interest, Patient_ID, Survival_time, Tumour_stage, Nottingham_prognostic_index)
```

Another less readable way of writing this code is to nest the `filter()`
function call inside the `select()`. Although this looks very unwieldy and is
not easy to follow, nested function calls are very common in a lot of R code
you may come across.

```{r}
patients_of_interest <- select(filter(metabric, Survival_status == "LIVING", Survival_time > 120), Patient_ID, Survival_time, Tumour_stage, Nottingham_prognostic_index)
nrow(patients_of_interest)
```

However, there is another way chaining together a series of operations into a
mini workflow that is elegant, intuitive and makes for very readable R code. We can use the **pipe** operator, **`%>%`**.

```{block type = "rmdblock"}
**The pipe operator `%>%`**

The pipe operator takes the output from one operation, i.e. whatever is on the
left-hand side of `%>%` and passes it in as the first argument to the second
operation, or function, on the right-hand side.

**`x %>% f(y)`** is equivalent to **`f(x, y)`**

For example:

`select(starwars, name, height, mass)`

can be rewritten as

`starwars %>% select(name, height, mass)`

This allows for chaining of operations into workflows, e.g.

`starwars %>%`<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`filter(species == "Droid") %>%`<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`select(name, height, mass)`

The `%>%` operator comes from the `magrittr` package (do you get the reference?)
and is available when we load the tidyverse using `library(tidyverse)`.

Piping in R was motivated by the Unix pipe, `|`, in which the output from one
process is redirected to be the input for the next. This is so named because the
flow from one process or operation to the next resembles a pipeline.

Note that since R v4.1 (released May 2021) R now has it's own native pipe `|>`.
```

We can rewrite the code for our filtering and column selection operations as
follows.

```{r}
patients_of_interest <- metabric %>%
  filter(Survival_status == "LIVING", Survival_time > 120) %>%
  select(Patient_ID, Survival_time, Tumour_stage, Nottingham_prognostic_index)
```

Note how each operation takes the output from the previous operation as its
first argument. This way of coding is embraced wholeheartedly in the tidyverse
hence almost every tidyverse function that works on data frames has the data
frame as its first argument. It is also the reason why tidyverse functions
return a data frame regardless of whether the output could be recast as a vector
or a single value.

"Piping", the act of chaining operations together, becomes really useful when
there are several steps involved in filtering and transforming a data set.

The usual way of developing a workflow is to build it up one step at a time,
testing the output produced at each stage. Let's do that for this case.

We start by considering just the patients who are living.

```{r}
patients_of_interest <- metabric %>%
  filter(Survival_status == "LIVING")
```

We then add another filter for the survival time.

```{r}
patients_of_interest <- metabric %>%
  filter(Survival_status == "LIVING") %>%
  filter(Survival_time > 120)
```

At each stage we look at the resulting `patients_of_interest` data frame to check
we're happy with the result.

Finally we only want certain columns, so we add a `select()` operation.

```{r}
patients_of_interest <- metabric %>%
  filter(Survival_status == "LIVING") %>%
  filter(Survival_time > 120) %>%
  select(Patient_ID, Survival_time, Tumour_stage, Nottingham_prognostic_index)
# print out the result
patients_of_interest
```

When continuing our workflow across multiple lines, we need to be careful to
ensure the `%>%` is at the end of the line. If we try to place this at the start
of the next line, R will think we've finished the workflow prematurely and will
report an error at what it considers the next statement, i.e. the line that
begins with `%>%`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# R considers the following to be 2 separate commands, the first of which ends
# with the first filter operation and runs successfully.
# The second statement is the third and last line, is not a valid commmand and
# so you'll get an error message
patients_of_interest <- metabric %>%
  filter(Survival_status == "LIVING")
  %>% filter(Survival_time > 120)
```

This is very similar to what we saw with adding layers and other components to
a ggplot using the `+` operator, where we needed the `+` to be at the end of a
line.

We'll be using the pipe `%>%` operator throughout the rest of the course so
you'd better get used to it. But actually we think you'll come to love it as
much as we do.

---

# Sorting using `arrange()`

It is sometimes quite useful to sort our data frame based on the values in one
or more of the columns, particularly when displaying the contents or saving them
to a file. The `arrange()` function in dplyr provides this sorting capability.

For example, we can sort the METABRIC patients into order of increasing
survival time.

```{r}
arrange(metabric, Survival_time)
```

Or we might be more interested in the patients that survived the longest so
would need the order to be of decreasing survival time. For that we can use
the helper function `desc()` that works specifically with `arrange()`.

```{r}
arrange(metabric, desc(Survival_time))
```

As with the other tidyverse functions and, in particular, the other 4 key dplyr
'verbs', `arrange()` works rather well in workflows in which successive
operations are chained using `%>%`.

```{r}
patients_of_interest <- metabric %>%
  filter(Survival_status == "LIVING") %>%
  filter(Survival_time > 120) %>%
  select(Patient_ID, Survival_time, Tumour_stage, Nottingham_prognostic_index) %>%
  arrange(desc(Survival_time))
# print out the result
patients_of_interest
```

We can sort by more than one variable by adding more variable arguments to
`arrange()`.

```{r}
arrange(patients_of_interest, Tumour_stage, Nottingham_prognostic_index)
```

Here we've sorted first by tumour stage from lowest to highest value and then
by the Nottingham prognostic index for when there are ties, i.e. where the
tumour stage is the same.

Sorting is most commonly used in workflows as one of the last steps before
printing out a data frame or writing out the table to a file.

---

# Modifying data using `mutate()`

In one of the examples of filtering observations using `filter()` above, we
created a new logical variable called `Deceased`.

```{r}
metabric$Deceased <- metabric$Survival_status == "DECEASED"
```

This is an example of a rather common type of data manipulation in which we
create a new column based on the values contained in one or more other columns.
The `dplyr` package provides the `mutate()` function for this purpose.

```{r}
metabric <- mutate(metabric, Deceased = Survival_status == "DECEASED")
```

Both of these methods add the new column to the end.

Note that variables names in the `mutate()` function call do not need to be
prefixed by `metabric$` just as they don't in any of the `dplyr` functions.

We can overwrite a column and this is quite commonly done when we want to change
the units. For example, our tumour size values are in millimetres but the
formula for the Nottingham prognostic index needs the tumour size to be in
centimetres. We can convert to `Tumour_size` to centimetres by dividing by 10.

```{r}
metabric <- mutate(metabric, Tumour_size = Tumour_size / 10)
```

```{block type = "rmdblock"}
**Nottingham Prognostic Index**

The Nottingham prognostic index (**NPI**) is used to determine prognosis
following surgery for breast cancer. Its value is calculated using three
pathological criteria: the size of the tumour, the number of lymph nodes
involved, and the grade of the tumour.

The formula for the Nottingham prognostic index is:

**`NPI = (0.2 * S) + N + G`**

where

* **S** is the size of the tumour in centimetres
* **N** is the node status (0 nodes = 1, 1-3 nodes = 2, >3 nodes = 3)
* **G** is the grade of tumour (Grade I = 1, Grade II = 2, Grade III = 3)
```

We'll recalculate the Nottingham prognostic index using the values
`Tumour_size`, `Neoplasm_histologic_grade` and `Lymph_node_status` columns in
our METABRIC data frame.

```{r}
metabric <- mutate(metabric, NPI = 0.2 * Tumour_size + Lymph_node_status + Neoplasm_histologic_grade)

select(metabric, Tumour_size, Lymph_node_status, Neoplasm_histologic_grade, NPI, Nottingham_prognostic_index)
```

There is a discrepency. Can you see what the problem is?

It appears that the tumour size wasn't correctly converted into centimetres in
the original NPI calculation or that the wrong scaling factor for tumour size
was used. This could explain why the plots we created in weeks 1 and 2 featuring
the Nottingham prognostic index looked so odd. We'll see if they look any better
with our recalculated values.

```{r scatter_plot_1}
ggplot(data = metabric) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Age_at_diagnosis, y = NPI), na.rm = TRUE)
```

There is still some banding but nothing like the NPI values downloaded from
cBioPortal which line up very closely to whole numbers.

The **`round()`** function is really useful for rounding numerical values to a
specified number of decimal places. We'll read in the METABRIC data again and
create a small workflow that carries out the tumour size conversion, computes
the NPI, rounds the tumour size and the resulting NPI value to 1 decimal place
and displays the results in decreasing order of NPI.

```{r message = FALSE}
read_csv("https://zenodo.org/record/6450144/files/metabric_clinical_and_expression_data.csv") %>%
  mutate(Tumour_size = Tumour_size / 10) %>%
  mutate(NPI = 0.2 * Tumour_size + Lymph_node_status + Neoplasm_histologic_grade) %>%
  mutate(Tumour_size = round(Tumour_size, digits = 1)) %>%
  mutate(NPI = round(NPI, digits = 1)) %>%
  arrange(desc(NPI)) %>%
  select(Tumour_size, Lymph_node_status, Neoplasm_histologic_grade, NPI)
```

## Mutating multiple columns

In that last workflow we included the same rounding operation applied to two
different variables. It would be nice to be able to carry out just the one
`mutate()` but apply it to both `Tumour_size` and `NPI` columns and we can using
**`across()`** inside `mutate()`. This allows us to apply a function across multiple columns.

```{r}
metabric %>%
  mutate(across(c(Tumour_size, NPI), round, digits = 1)) %>%
  select(Patient_ID, Tumour_size, NPI)
```

This is slightly more complicated. Inside `across()` we had to group the variables for which we
want the function to apply using `c()`. We then gave the function name as the
next argument and finally any additional arguments that the function needs, in
this case the number of digits.

We can use the range operator and the same helper functions as we did for
selecting columns using `select()` inside `across()`.

For example, we might decide that our expression values are given to a much
higher degree of precision than is strictly necessary.

```{r}
metabric %>%
  mutate(across(ESR1:MLPH, round, digits = 2)) %>%
  select(Patient_ID, ESR1:MLPH)
```

Or we could decide that all the columns whose names end with "_status" are in
fact categorical variables and should be converted to factors.

```{r}
metabric %>%
  mutate(across(ends_with("_status"), as.factor)) %>%
  select(Patient_ID, ends_with("_status"))
```

## Anonymous functions (ADVANCED)

The `mutate` function with `across` is really very powerful but with that comes additional complexity.

For example, we may come across situations where we'd like to apply the same
operation to multiple columns but where there is no available function in R
to do what we want.

Let's say we want to convert the petal and sepal measurements in the `iris`
data set from centimetres to millimetres. We'd either need to create a new
function to do this conversion or we could use what is known as an anonymous
function, also known as a lambda expression.

There is no 'multiply by 10' function and it seems a bit pointless to create
one just for this conversion so we'll use an anonymous function instead --
anonymous because it has no name, it's an _in situ_ function only used in our
`mutate` with `across` function call.

```{r}
iris %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(across(Sepal.Length:Petal.Width, ~ . * 10))
```

The **`~`** denotes that we're using an anonymous function (it is the symbol for
formulae in R) and the `.` is a placeholder for the column being operated on. In
this case, we're multiplying each of the columns between `Sepal.Length` and
`Petal.Width` inclusive by 10.

If you think this is getting fairly complicated you'd be right. We'll leave it
there for now but point you to vignette("colwise") if you're
interested in finding out more information on how column-wise operations with `across` work.

# Computing summary values using `summarise()`

We'll cover the fifth of the main dplyr 'verb' functions, **`summarise()`**,
only briefly here. This function computes summary values for one or more
variables (columns) in a table. Here we will summarise values for the entire
table but this function is much more useful in combination with `group_by()`
in working on groups of observations within the data set. We will look at
summarizing groups of observations next week.

Any function that calculates a single scalar value from a vector can be used
with `summarise()`. For example, the `mean()` function calculates the arithmetic
mean of a numeric vector. Let's calculate the average ESR1 expression for tumour
samples in the METABRIC data set.

```{r}
mean(metabric$ESR1)
```

The equivalent operation using `summarise()` is:

```{r}
summarise(metabric, mean(ESR1))
```

If you prefer Oxford spelling, in which -ize is preferred to -ise, you’re in
luck as dplyr accommodates the alternative spelling.

Both of the above statements gave the same average expression value but these
were output in differing formats. The `mean()` function collapses a vector to
single scalar value, which as we know is in fact a vector of length 1. The
`summarise()` function, as with most tidyverse functions, returns another data
frame, albeit one in which there is a single row and a single column.

Returning a data frame might be quite useful, particularly if we’re summarising
multiple columns or using more than one function, for example computing the
average and standard deviation.

```{r}
summarise(metabric, ESR1_mean = mean(ESR1), ESR1_sd = sd(ESR1))
```

Notice how we also named the output columns in this last example.

```{block type = "rmdblock"}
**`summarise()`**

`summarise()` collapses a data frame into a single row by calculating summary
values of one or more of the columns.

It can take any function that takes a vector of values and returns a single
value. Some of the more useful functions include:

* Centre: **`mean()`**, **`median()`**
* Spread: **`sd()`**, **`mad()`**
* Range: **`min()`**, **`max()`**, **`quantile()`**
* Position: **`first()`**, **`last()`**
* Count: **`n()`**

Note the `first()`, `last()` and `n()` are only really useful when working on
groups of observations using **`group_by()`**.

**`n()`** is a special function that returns the number of observations; it
doesn't take a vector argument, i.e. a column.
```

It is also possible to summarise using a function that takes more than one
value, i.e. from multiple columns. For example, we could compute the correlation
between the expression of FOXA1 and MLPH.

```{r}
summarise(metabric, correlation = cor(FOXA1, MLPH))
```

## Summarizing multiple columns

Similar to `mutate()`, `summarise()` can be used with `across()`for
applying the same summarization function to multiple columns in a single
operation.

Inside `across()` we give the columns we
want the function to apply, followed by the function name. Selecting the columns is done in the same way as for `mutate()` with `across()`, whatever works for `select()` e.g.`c()`, `:`, `starts_with()`.

```{r}
summarise(metabric, across(c(FOXA1, MLPH), mean))
```


```{r}
summarise(metabric, across(ESR1:MLPH, mean))
```

You have to be careful with `summarise()` and `across()` that all columns can be summarised
with the given summary function. For example, what happens if we try to compute
an average of a set of character values?

Note we can use `everything()` if we want to use across with all columns.

```{r}
summarise(metabric, across(everything(), mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

We get a lot of warning messages and `NA` values for those columns for which
computing an average does not make sense.

**`where()`** can be used to select those values for which a
summarization function is appropriate, for example, where the column is of type numeric.

```{r}
summarise(metabric, across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

It is possible to summarise using more than one function in which case a list of
functions needs to be provided.

```{r}
summarise(metabric, across(c(ESR1, ERBB2, PGR), list(mean, sd)))
```

Pretty neat but I'm not sure about those column headings in the output --
fortunately we have some control over these.

```{r}
summarise(metabric, across(c(ESR1, ERBB2, PGR), list(average = mean, stdev = sd)))
```

## Anonymous functions (ADVANCED)

The `mutate` and `summarise` functions with `across()` work in a very similar
manner, very much in line with the coherent and consistent framework provided
by `dplyr` and the entire tidyverse. For example, we could use an anonymous
function with `across()` in a `summarise()` operation to apply to multiple variables. In the
assignment from last week, we asked you to compute the correlation of the
expression for FOXA1 against all other genes to see which was most strongly
correlated. Here is how we could do this in a single `summarise()` statement
using an anonymous function.

```{r}
summarise(metabric, across(c(ESR1:MLPH, -FOXA1), ~ cor(., FOXA1)))
```

Notice how we selected all genes between ESR1, the first gene column in our
data frame, and MLPH, the last gene column, but then excluded FOXA1 as we're not
all that interested in the correlation of FOXA1 with itself (we know the answer
is 1).

# Faceting with ggplot2

Finally, let's change tack completely and take a look at a very useful feature
of ggplot2 -- **faceting**.

Faceting allows you to split your plot into subplots, or facets, based on one
or more categorical variables. Each of the subplots displays a subset of the
data.

There are two faceting functions, **`facet_wrap()`** and **`facet_grid()`**.

Let's create a scatter plot of GATA3 and ESR1 expression values where we're
displaying the PR positive and PR negative patients using different colours.
This is a very similar to a plot we created last session

```{r scatter_plot_2}
ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1, colour = PR_status)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5)
```

An alternative is to use faceting with **`facet_wrap()`**.

```{r scatter_plot_3}
ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(vars(PR_status))
```

This produces two plots, side-by-side, one for each of the categories in the
`PR_status` variable, with a banner across the top of each for the category.

The variable(s) used for faceting can be specified using `vars()`.

We can still use separate colours if we prefer things to be, well, colourful.

```{r scatter_plot_4}
ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1, colour = PR_status)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(vars(PR_status))
```

Faceting is usually better than displaying groups using different colours when
there are more than two or three groups when it can be difficult to really tell
which points belong to each group. A case in point is for the 3-gene
classification in the GATA3 vs ESR1 scatter plot we created last week. Let's
create a faceted version of that plot.

```{r scatter_plot_5}
ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1, colour = `3-gene_classifier`)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(vars(`3-gene_classifier`))
```

This helps explain why the function is called `facet_wrap()`. When it has too
many subplots to fit across the page, it wraps around to another row. We can
control how many rows or columns to use with the `nrow` and `ncol` arguments.

```{r scatter_plot_6}
ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1, colour = `3-gene_classifier`)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(vars(`3-gene_classifier`), nrow = 1)
```

```{r scatter_plot_7}
ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1, colour = `3-gene_classifier`)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(vars(`3-gene_classifier`), ncol = 2)
```

We can combine faceting on one variable with a colour aesthetic for another
variable. For example, let's show the tumour stage status using faceting and the HER2
status using colours.

```{r scatter_plot_8}
ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1, colour = HER2_status)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(vars(Neoplasm_histologic_grade))
```

Instead of this we could facet on more than variable.

```{r scatter_plot_9}
ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(vars(Neoplasm_histologic_grade, HER2_status))
```

Faceting on two variables is usually better done using the other faceting
function, **`facet_grid()`**. Note the change in how the formula is written.

```{r scatter_plot_10}
ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(vars(Neoplasm_histologic_grade), vars(HER2_status))
```

Again we can use colour aesthetics alongside faceting to add further information
to our visualization.

```{r scatter_plot_11}
ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1, colour = PAM50)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(vars(Neoplasm_histologic_grade), vars(HER2_status))
```

Finally, we can use a `labeller` to change the labels for each of the
categorical values so that these are more meaningful in the context of this
plot.

```{r scatter_plot_12}
grade_labels <- c("1" = "Grade I", "2" = "Grade II", "3" = "Grade III")
her2_status_labels <- c("Positive" = "HER2 positive", "Negative" = "HER2 negative")
#
ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1, colour = PAM50)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(vars(Neoplasm_histologic_grade),
             vars(HER2_status),
             labeller = labeller(
               Neoplasm_histologic_grade = grade_labels,
               HER2_status = her2_status_labels
              )
            )
```

This would certainly be necessary if we were to use ER and HER2 status on one
side of the grid.

```{r scatter_plot_13}
er_status_labels <- c("Positive" = "ER positive", "Negative" = "ER negative")
#
ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1, colour = PAM50)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(vars(Neoplasm_histologic_grade),
             vars(ER_status, HER2_status),
             labeller = labeller(
               Neoplasm_histologic_grade = grade_labels,
               ER_status = er_status_labels,
               HER2_status = her2_status_labels
              )
            )
```
