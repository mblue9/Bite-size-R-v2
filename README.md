# Introduction

This site contains the materials for an R course run by Peter Mac.

The materials were adapted from the course run by the Bioinformatics Core
at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute (Contributions : Matthew Eldridge, Chandra Chilamakuri, Mark Fernandes, Ashley Sawle, Kamal Kishore, Sergio Martinez Cuesta, Rory Stark).

April-May 2022

# Instructors

* Maria Doyle, Research Computing
* Cassie Litchfield, Bioinformatics Core
* Miriam Yeung, Dawson Labs

# Description

**R** is one of the leading programming languages in **Data Science** and the
most widely used within Peter Mac for interacting with, analyzing and visualizing cancer biology datasets. In this training, we aim to provide **a friendly 'next-steps' R course for beginners** who have been through an introductory R training and would like to consolidate their skills. It is an opportunity for increasing skills through supported practice using cancer biology data as part of a class.

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this course you should be able to:  

* Interact with R using RStudio  
* Import/export data (e.g. Excel, csv files) into/from R  
* Manipulate and reformat tabular data  
* Create visualisations (scatterplots, bar charts, boxplots, histograms and line graphs for time series data)  
* Generate reproducible reports for your analyses

# This course is for you if

* You've completed DataCamp's [Introduction to the Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse) (contact Maria if you're a Peter Mac staff/student who needs access) and are looking to build on your skills. Alternatively, previous attendance at University of Melbourne's [Introduction to R](https://gateway.research.unimelb.edu.au/events/researcher-connect#digital-skills-training) or equivalent is sufficient. 
* You have ~1-2 hours to spend on the course each week during the 4 weeks (working through material and exercises in your own time at your own pace) and are able to attend all 4 live 1hr (recap/Q&A) sessions.

# Structure

The course will be run over **4 sessions** with the following structure:

* **Material** covering the concepts introduced in the lesson to go through in your own time with an **assignment** consisting of exercises to practice some of the concepts covered in that and previous lessons (~1-2hrs per week)
* **Live recap/Q&A session** hybrid format, online and in-person (1hr per week) 
* **Teams channel** for the class to ask any questions or get help in-between the live sessions
