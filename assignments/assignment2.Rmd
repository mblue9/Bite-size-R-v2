title: "Assignment 2"
---

The week's assignment will test your ability to create various different types
of plot. It includes some extension exercises which you can consider optional.

```{r eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
metabric <- read_csv("https://zenodo.org/record/6450144/files/metabric_clinical_and_expression_data.csv")
```

**1. Create a bar plot showing the number of patients with tumours at each of the different neoplasm histologic grades**

```{r}

```

Turn this into a stacked bar plot showing the proportions of patients with each
histologic grade that had chemotherapy

```{r}

```

**Extension**

ggplot gives a warning about non-finite values, i.e. the missing values. Find
out how to get rid of this warning.

```{r}

```

Let's say we are interested in displaying the missing values as a separate
category and recreate the bar plot with an additional column.

```{r}

```

---

**2. Create a density plot of the estrogen receptor (ESR1) expression level**

```{r}

```

_Hint: this is a new plot type -- look up the geom you need by looking at the
list of functions for the ggplot2 package in the Packages tab in RStudio._

Create separate but overlaying density plots for ESR1 expression for HER2
positive and negative patients. Try to ensure that both density plots are
visible.

```{r}

```

---

**3. Create box plots for the survival time of patients with different tumour stages only including deceased patients**

```{r}

```

_Hint: if you get a warning message and only have a single box displayed
consider the type of the tumour stage variable as read into R and what kind of
variable is expected for the x aesthetic._

Convert this into a violin plot and display ER negative and ER positive patients
separately.

```{r}

```

_Hint: look at the help for geom_boxplot._

**4. Explore the correlation between FOXA1 and MLPH**

A recently-published paper looks at associations of expression and genomic data
in the METABRIC data set. It found a strong correlation between FOXA1 and one of the other genes included in our table, MLPH (see the output of `cor.test(metabric$FOXA1,  metabric$MLPH)`).


Create a scatter plot of the expression of FOXA1 and MLPH with a line of best fit.

```{r}

```

Change the method used to draw the line of best fit to be a straight line.

```{r}

```

**EXTRA. If you did the optional EXTRA part in the material. Explore the Apple Mobility data on transport use during the coronavirus lockdown using line plots**

The Government included in their daily press conference a new set
of data of transport use as measured by direction requests on Apple Maps.

Search for and download the UK Government data for the Sunday briefing (26 April
2020).

_Hint: use the search terms "uk government coronavirus press conference data"._

Load the 'Apple Mobility' sheet into R. You will need to specify the
worksheet and a few other arguments as the data are not in the most convenient
format (see how the transport use worksheet was read into R in the course
materials).

```{r}

```

Plot the 7-day rolling average against date as a line graph with separate lines
for each mode of transport.

```{r}

```

What is the main (and obvious) conclusion to draw from this plot?

Now plot the daily percentage instead of the 7-day rolling average.

```{r}

```

What do you notice about daily fluctuations?

**Extension**

Create a new column for the weekday (taking values Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
etc.) in the Apple Mobility table and plot just the daily percentage for walking
but now as separate lines for each day of the week.

```{r}

```

_Hint: use a function from the lubridate package, another of the tidyverse
packages (install if necessary)._
